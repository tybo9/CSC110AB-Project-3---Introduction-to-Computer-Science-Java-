 Programming Project   # 14 Page 418 (4th Edition)    OR      #14 Page 424 (5th Edition)
Write the program described in # 14 on page 418 of the textbook. Summary is as follows:
1.	A five digit PIN from 00000 to 99999 is required to access the account.
2.	Each digit will be randomly generated as a 1, 2, or 3 to replace the actual PIN.
3.	The program will simulate authentication by the user entering the correct substituted digit for the actual PIN.
PIN                       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 
Random NUM    3 2 1 2 1 3 2 2 1 3    //These substitute for the digits 0-9
Test of the program:
Actual PIN:      95083                          //Actual PIN before encryption
Access NUM:  33312                          //These are the encrypted access numbers
Message: “ACCESS GRANTED”        //If 33312 was entered
4.	 Use an array to assign random numbers from 0 to 9.
5.	See the text description for details on how to implement the solution. 
6.	Use arrays to hold the PIN and random numbers for substitution.

INPUT/OUTPUT/SUBMIT
Hard code the actual PIN into the program to test it. When you have successfully entered the substitute PIN, display a message stating a correct PIN has been entered. If not, display a message of access denied. Output the generated random digits to the screen, the input response from the user, and the access message. Submit the relevant screen shots of the tested program.
